knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

## Data and packages

Load the entirety of the `{tidyverse}`.
Be sure to avoid printing out any unnecessary information and give the code chunk a meaningful name.

```{r loading_tidy, collapse=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```


In this activity we will explore joining information that is contained in multiple data files.
We will also explore ways of visualizing spatial data.

The late comedian [Mitch Hedberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg) believed that La Quinta (pronounced la KEEN-ta) was Spanish for "next to Denny's".

![Mitch Hedberg](https://duckduckgrayduck.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/mitch-hedberg.jpg)

In the `data` folder, you have been provided with three `.csv` files.
The `dennys.csv` and `laquinta.csv` files contains addresses for the locations of each respective company.
The `states.csv` file contains the area (thousand square miles) for each US state and the District of Columbia.
These data were scrapped from [Denny's](https://locations.dennys.com/) and [La Quinta's](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/laquinta/locations) location web pages by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel.

Read each of the three files using `here::here` in combination with the appropriate `{readr}` function.
Assign each file to a meaningful object name (e.g., `dennys`,`laquinta`, and `states`), be sure to avoid printing any unnecessary information.
Give your code chunk a meaningful name.

```{r reading_files}
dennys <- read.csv(here::here("data",'dennys.csv'))
laquinta <- read.csv(here::here("data",'laquinta.csv'))
states <- read.csv(here::here("data",'states.csv'))
```



### Provide more information

`class`, `str`, `nrow`, `ncol`, and `names` are extremely helpful functions for quickly getting information about a dataset.
Below is a brief summary of the information that each function provides.

- `class`: Returns the attribute of the R object
- `str`: A compact display of the internal structure of an R object. This can also be viewed by clicking on the blue circle icon next to the R object in the **Environment** pane (upper-right pane).
- `nrow`: Returns the number of rows in an R object
- `ncol`: Returns the number of columns in an R object
- `names`: Get or set the names of an R object (e.g., the column names for a dataset)

Use the output from `str` of these datasets to complete the `Type` column in the partially started data dictionary tables below.

```{r data_info}
str(dennys)
str(laquinta)
str(states)
```

## Analysis

### Locations in the US

We will limit our analysis to Denny's and La Quinta's locations within the United States
Look at the websites that the data come from (linked above).
Are there any La Quinta’s locations outside of the US?
What about Denny’s?

**Response**: There are 59 distinct states for laquinta, so there are locations outside the US, but there are only 51 for dennys, so there are no locations outside the US.

```{r}
distinct(select(laquinta,state))
distinct(select(dennys,state))
```


If we wanted to do this using the datasets, would we need to ?
Don’t worry about implementing this yet, you only need to brainstorm some ideas.
Include at least one idea as your answer, but you are welcome to write down a few options too.

**Response**: I did this by looking at distinct values of state


### Preparing to Join

#### Denny's

Now we will find the Denny’s locations that are outside the US using code.
To do so, *filter* the Denny’s locations for observations where state is *not in* `states$abbreviation`.
Do not assign this to anything; we only want to see if we need to be aware of non-US cases.
If there are any non-US locations, specify where these are.

```{r}
dennys %>% filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))
```

**Response**: The dataset is empty so every dennys is in a US State


Now do this again, but using `anti_join`.
To do so, take the Denny's locations and anti-join this with the states dataset.
Remember to specify your `by` columns.

```{r}
dennys %>% anti_join(states, by=c('state'="abbreviation"))
```

#### A Brief Aside

Another way to do this would be to create a new variable (called, says, `country`), then filter on this new variable.
Remember that `mutate` creates new variables.
Then `dplyr::case_when` function is a nice way to do multiple if-else statements.
For example, your instructor could see if there are any Denny's in any the states that your instructor has lived in:

```{r,message=FALSE}
#dennys %>%
#  mutate(bradford_lived = case_when(
#    state %in% c("MI", "NC", "IL", "ME") ~ "Yes",
#    TRUE ~ "No"))
```

`case_when` looks to see if any of the `dennys$state`s are in the vector of state abbreviations that I have lived (i.e., `c("MI", "NC", "IL", "ME")`).
If this is a `TRUE` statement, then `bradford_lived` will be set to `"Yes"`.
Otherwise, if the values is not a missing value (i.e., `NA`), the `TRUE ~ "NO"` line sets `bradford_lived` to `"No`.
If the values are missing, they remain missing in `bradford_lived`.
Without the `TRUE ~ "No"` line, all values except for "MI", "NC", "IL", and "ME" would be set to missing values.

Note that we could have also used `!(state %in% c("MI", "NC", "IL", "ME")) ~ "NO"`.
However, this would be slightly inefficient to type as `TRUE ~ "No"` captures this.

To create a new variable called `country` where if the state is in the US, `country` is set to `"United States"` we would then do:

```{r case_when, message=FALSE}
#dennys %>% 
#  mutate(country = case_when(
#    state %in% states$abbreviation ~ "United States",
#    TRUE ~ "Other")) %>% 
#  filter(country != "Other")
```

#### La Quinta

Determine if La Quinta has any locations that are outside of the US.

**Response**: There are multiple la quinta locations outside the US

```{r}
laquinta %>% anti_join(states, by=c('state'="abbreviation"))
```

#### Isolating US locations

For the rest of this activity, we will work with the data from the United States *only*.
All Denny's locations in our file are in the US so we do not need to worry about updating this object, but you do need to do some work on the `laquinta` data.
Create a new object called `laquinta_us` that only contains the locations inside the US.

```{r}
laquinta_us <- laquinta %>% 
  right_join(states, by=c('state'="abbreviation"))
```

### Fewest locations

Let's test some of our data summary skills.

Which US state(s) has/ve the fewest Denny's location?

```{r}
dennys2 <- dennys %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(total=n()) %>% 
  arrange(total)
```

**Response**: Delaware has the fewest dennys locations


Which US state(s) has/ve the fewest La Quinta locations?

```{r}
laquinta2 <- laquinta_us %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(total=n()) %>% 
  arrange(total)
```

**Response**: DC, DE, HI, and ME all have 1 la quinta

Is this surprising to you? Why or why not?

**Response**: It is surprising to see that states with few dennys also have fewer la quinta


### Locations per thousand square miles

Next we will calculate which states have the most Denny's and La Quinta locations per thousand square miles.
To do this, we will need to join each company's tibble with the information in the `states` tibble.

#### Denny's

1. Take the `dennys` tibble and determine how many observations are in each state.
  This should have two columns: `state` and `n`.
2. *Then*, use `inner_join` to join the previous information to the `states` tibble.
  Note that the variables in the `states` tibble has the two letter abbreviations in a column called `abbreviation`.
  Therefore, we will need to specify that the `state` variable from the `dennys` tibble should be matched `by` the `abbreviation` variable from the `states` tibble.
3. *Then*, calculate the number of Denny's locations *per* thousand square miles.

```{r}
dennys2 %>% 
  inner_join(states, by=c('state'='abbreviation')) %>% 
  mutate(per_1000_sq_mi=total/area) %>% 
  arrange(desc(per_1000_sq_mi))
```

Which states have the most Denny's locations per thousand square miles?

**Response**: DC has the most


#### La Quinta

Similarly as we previously did for Denny's, calculate the number of La Quinta locations *per* thousand square miles.

```{r}
laquinta2 %>% 
  inner_join(states, by=c('state'='abbreviation')) %>% 
  mutate(per_1000_sq_mi=total/area) %>% 
  arrange(desc(per_1000_sq_mi))
```

**Response**: DC also has the most



<img src="README-img/noun_pause.png" alt="pause" width = "20"/> <b>Planned Pause Point</b>: If you feel that you have a good understanding of these commands, feel free to start working on your project. The remainder of this activity will deal with creating map data visualizations.

### Mapping locations

To be able to map all of the `dennys` and `laquinta` locations, we should combine them into one dataset.

Both of these tibbles have the same columns in the same order (i.e., `address`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `longitude`, `latitude`, `country`) so we can simply stack them on top of each other by using `bind_rows`.

Why would it not be wise to use a mutating join (e.g., `inner_join`, `left/right_join`, `full_join`) for these data?
That is, both of the datasets have the same variable names, would it not make sense to join them at the same address?

**Response**: They have different types for zip codes


If we were able to use a mutating join, what would this output would look like?
Why would this not be helpful?

**Response**:


You were already shown these top-notch animations from [Garrick Aden-Blue](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/).
Again, they are a little old as they still use `spread` and `gather`, but the `*_join` are still accurate.

Prior to combining these datasets, it would be nice to know which company each location belongs to.

```{r add_establishment}
pre_join_dennys <- dennys %>% 
  mutate(establishment = "Denny's")

pre_join_laquinta_us <- laquinta_us %>% 
  mutate(establishment = "La Quinta") %>% 
  transform(zip=as.integer(zip))
```

Now, stack these two `pre_join_*` tibbles on top of each other.
After you have verified the stacking worked, assign the resulting object to `dennys_laquinta`.

```{r}
bind_rows(pre_join_dennys, pre_join_laquinta_us)
```

We can plot the locations of the two establishments using a scatter plot and color the points by the establishment type.
Note that longitude should be plotted on the *x*-axis and latitude on the *y*-axis.




**Response**:


### More with visualizing

The following two items ask you to create visualizations.
These should follow best practices such as informative titles, axis labels, etc.
See http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html for help with the syntax.

You can also choose different themes to change the overall look of your plots.
See http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html for help with these.

The general idea here is that create the map using a dataset of shape files, then overlay a layer of points using a different dataset.

Note that [choropleth maps](https://r-charts.com/spatial/choropleth-map-ggplot2/) are slightly different in that you would need to joining the shape file and the data containing ammounts to shade each shape.

#### Michigan locations

Filter the data for observations in Michigan only, and create a plot.
Try adjusting the transparency of the points by setting the `alpha` level (so that it is easier to see the over-plotted ones).
Visually, does Mitch Hedberg’s joke appear to hold in Michigan?




**Response**:


#### Texas locations

Now filter the data for observations in Texas only.
Create the plot, with an appropriate `alpha` level.
Visually, does Mitch Hedberg’s joke appear to hold here?




**Response**:


### Challenge: Dress up your maps

Hadley's [ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org/maps.html) text shows how to use the `geom_polygon` and `coord_quickmap` layers to create state outlines when plotting spatial data.

This blog post series on **r-spatial** goes into a lot more detail for dressing up maps:

- [Basics](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf.html)
- [Layers](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf-2.html)
- [Layout](https://www.r-spatial.org/r/2018/10/25/ggplot2-sf-3.html)

Add state boundaries to each of your maps.
Do this within each of the previous code chunks.
